# CellRecognition
A python script which is used for segmenting cells from provided images. Script is designed to recognize cells from certain images, one of them is provided in test directory. Algorithm must be improved in order to detect cells from wider range of images. This is a university project.

## Steps
1. Edge detection
1. Connecting close disconnected edges
1. Eliminating small objects
1. Filling contours
1. For each cell, determining if it needs further operation
1. Isolating unfinished cells
1. Connecting further edges
1. Filling newly formed contours
1. Merging previous results with current

## Necessary Improvements
1. Algorithm must be optimized to run faster.
1. Algorithm must be improved in order to detect cells from wider range of images.
